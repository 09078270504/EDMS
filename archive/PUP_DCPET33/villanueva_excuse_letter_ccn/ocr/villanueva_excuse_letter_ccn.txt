Re: Excuse for Absence on January 5-6, 2026
Dear Ma'am:
am writing to inform you that will be unable to attend the first day of classes on January 5 and 6 of 2026 due to my return flight from the province being scheduled on January 7 . Because of the holiday season, earlier return flights were limited and significantly more costly, leaving this as the most feasible option.
regret missing the opening day and appreciate your understanding: remain fully committed to my academic responsibilities and will promptly make up for any missed lessons or requirements upon my return:
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Shania Jarrisse S. Villanueva 2023-09743-MN-0 DCPET 3-3
